# 🧾 Project Description – Expense & Budget Tracker

This project is a **GUI-based personal expense and budget tracker** built using Python. It is designed to help individuals keep track of their daily expenditures while maintaining an overview of their monthly budget.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter**: For building the user interface
- **CSV Module**: For storing and reading expense data locally
- **Matplotlib**: For generating pie charts of category-wise expenses

### 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide users with a **minimal, intuitive, and local solution** to track how much money they spend, where they spend it, and how it compares to their preset monthly budget.

### 🧠 Key Functionalities

- **Budget Setting**: Users can input a monthly budget to monitor their spending.
- **Expense Entry**: Add expense details such as category, amount, and an optional note.
- **Persistent Data**: Expenses are saved in a CSV file so that data is preserved across sessions.
- **Expense Report**: View a pop-up report that includes total expenses, remaining budget, and per-category breakdown.
- **Graphical Chart**: A pie chart visualizes the distribution of expenses across different categories.

### 📝 Output Format

Data saved in `data.csv` includes:

- **Date**
- **Category**
- **Amount**
- **Note**

Each time the user adds an expense, it is logged in this file.

### 📈 Potential Improvements

- Add monthly filtering
- Export report as PDF
- Add authentication or password protection
- Add recurring expense detection
